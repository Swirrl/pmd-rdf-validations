#! PMDCUBE-Validation. Single measure on measure dimension observation
# Base RDF Data Cube IC-16
# In a qb:DataSet which uses a Measure dimension then each qb:Observation must only have a value for one measure 
# (by IC-15 this will be the measure corresponding to its qb:measureType). 
# In PMD data, measure values can have an option obsStatus marker to note a reason for a missing measure value
